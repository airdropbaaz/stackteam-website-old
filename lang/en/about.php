        'quotation'=>'Stack Team was a restart with power, I am Mehdi Homeyli, the CEO and Co-Funder of Stackteam, for years I have worked in the field of programming with large Iranian startups such as Netberg, Chillivari, etc., from major Iranian news agencies to develop sites and applications to startups big and small, the experience I gained showed me the reason for the failure of newly established startups, even why the failure of large startups happens, and I was looking for the reason for the lack of success in technical and software discussions, the biggest problem that In all startups and ideas, there was a wrong structure of software production and development, in fact, a wrong way of cooperation, the inability of startups to manage their team, or not receiving proper support from the software company, or even stopping cooperation for no reason. Freelancer in a project, all this made another application or website unable to be developed, and after a while the startup died!<p>&nbsp;</p> I would like to make sure that no more startups and ideas fail due to technical and programming reasons And we can guarantee this 100%, and if the reason for the failure remains, it has nothing to do with the software. We saw a foreign example and even cooperated with the way that our partner only engages in marketing and not software development. The x-team startup called <a href="https://x-team.com/" target="_blank">x-team.com</a> was great, the opinions of their partners from all over the world were attractive to me and The famous statement of the CEO of Twitter who said x-team is future was a green light for me to do this work in Iran and even serve other countries, so we also said that Stackteam is future and start with strength. We did it, but there was a place for localization so that we can make it attractive for companies and startups and even innovative organizations in Iran. The result of all these years of efforts was Team Stack, and now we are really happy that we can provide the highest quality service to our partners. <br>',
